        <p>
          Out of her creative passions for music, but because of her love for 
          lyrics, a songwriter was born. Susie "Barely Saved" Newton began writing 
          songs at the age of 12 when she was part of a neighborhood girl group called 
          "Flava"—this was Spring of '93 before Living Single debuted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inspired by Toni Braxton, Susie fell in love with the instrumental of 
          "Another Sad Love Song," which reflected the flow of relationships: battered, 
          loved, lost, reinvented. Susie wrote the group's first song, weaving together 
          what she knew of love—a love that never seemed to last, a love that left, or a 
          love that was lost to addiction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite this, music has always served its purpose in her life—from home to church, 
          from love through loss. Susie always found a key to soothe her soul. In 2007, a serious 
          relationship rekindled her love for lyrics and songwriting.
        </p>
        <p>
          But as life unfolded, love faded. After losing her love, Susie later married, registering 
          under BMI as Susie Bailey. It was then, after an energetic conversation with her husband, 
          that "Barely Saved" and Saved & Still Sexy Radio were born: "Just because you are saved 
          doesn’t mean stop being sexy." Though challenges overtook their marriage, Susie never stopped 
          pursuing her passions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Armed with a ten-year manuscript, songs, lyrics, four more chronicles, one deceased fiancé, 
          and two failed marriages, Susie still stands. Song, music, lyrics, and words remain her comfort. 
          Strengthened by God, she rebranded Saved & Still Sexy Radio in November 2016, dropping the "Still" 
          and keeping it real—just one month before losing her second fiancé.
        </p>
        <p>
          Saved N Sexy Radio has grown beyond her early vision. It’s no longer just a platform for a grieving 
          widow or mourning divorcee who happens to be a songwriter, poet, and writer. It’s a flourishing platform 
          for indie authors through the Authors Club (originally #ConstanceCorner), named after one of her beloved 
          characters, Constance Eubanks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Susie chose to grow better, not bitter. Her vision expanded into ReBrand Your Network, "when enough just 
          won’t do," under parent company G.I. Management & Consulting, with Saved N Sexy Radio fueling her nonprofit, 
          Plays For A Purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          And in the spirit of hope, love, and peace, she created Plays For A Purpose to promote unity within the 
          community—between sex, race, lifestyle, business, and health.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is the sincere hope, pleasure, and honor of Susie "Barely Saved" Newton that you enjoy, grow, and 
          continue to be great with us as we unite communities, one paid sponsor of Saved N Sexy Radio at a time.
        </p>
        <p>Peace, love, and prosperity to you,</p>
        <p>The Crew!</p>
